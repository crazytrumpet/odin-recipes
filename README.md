Project: Recipes

In this project, I will be using html skills I have gained by making a recipe website with links to to a few recipes. 

I will be using the following skills:
 - using an html boilerplate from scratch
 - using tags to emphasize text
 - using embedded links to go to other pages
 - using img tags to embed photos (possibly)
